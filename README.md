Automated Reconstruction of Bones from 2D to 3D
A machine-learning-based project for the automated reconstruction of 3D bone shapes from 2D images.

üåü Key Features
Machine Learning Integration: Uses machine learning models to analyze 2D input images (like X-rays or scans) and generate corresponding 3D bone models.

Procedural Generation: The project may also include procedural methods to refine and finalize the reconstructed 3D models.

Artistic Manipulation: Provides a framework for artists to easily modify and sculpt anatomically-inspired 3D models.

Clean Geometry: Focuses on creating clean, animatable, and game-ready mesh topologies.

2D to 3D Reconstruction: The core goal is to develop an automated method for reconstructing a 3D bone model from 2D image data.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for the machine learning pipeline.

TensorFlow/PyTorch: (or other relevant ML frameworks) Used for building and training the reconstruction models.

Blender: Used for data visualization, sculpting, and finalizing the generated 3D models.

Blender Python API: (Optional) Used to create custom tools within Blender for handling the reconstructed models.

üì¶ How to Get Started
Prerequisites
Python: Install Python 3.x.

Blender: Download and install Blender from the official Blender website.

Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries. You can usually do this with pip.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You'll need to create a requirements.txt file listing all the necessary libraries like tensorflow, numpy, scipy, etc.)

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/ashrayshetty001/bone-shape-sculptor.git
Navigate into the project directory:

Bash

cd bone-shape-sculptor
Usage
Run the main script to perform the 2D to 3D reconstruction.

Bash

python main.py --input_image path/to/your/image.png
The script will generate a 3D model file (e.g., .obj or .blend). You can then open this file in Blender for further viewing or editing.
